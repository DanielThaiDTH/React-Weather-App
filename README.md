# React Weather App
This app was developed for BTI 425. It uses the OpenWeather API to obtain weather data. The app can retrive the current weather of any city matching the user queries.

## Building
Create a Node .env file at the root and define a environment variable named REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_KEY, with the value being your OpenWeather API key.
